# Technikalia
- Built with web technologies, so it is highly accessible
- For now it is a proof of concept
- easy to deploy and maintain, as it uses docker and microservice architecture
# Goals
- Allow users to easily create gif's from their favorite shows
	- many streaming services don't allow their users to even take screenshots
	- As a result, the creator of *The Owl House* has been spotted posting screenshots of *her own show* from a pirate site
- Give the paying customers something the pirates have, the ability to share.
	- "One thing that we have learned is that piracy is not a pricing issue. **It's a service issue**" - Gabe Newell
- Organic marketing by making it easier for the audience to engage with the show.
