abstract = {The problem to be addressed by this study is a type of cybersecurity issue known as a zero-day vulnerability. A zero-day vulnerability is a moderately new form of cyber warfare and is an attack or threat that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application. The purpose of this qualitative research project is to evaluate past cyber threats, synthesize and evaluate the threats, then produce a best practices strategy for the Information Technology Department Supervisor employed by a higher learning education facility. The goal of the research question is to identify the security parameters (if any) used for different cyber transactions and each cyber breach. Compiling this data focuses on proactivity of the effected entity, and identifies trends in the failure of securing cyber space. This research design uses a constant comparison analysis and focuses on the relationship between zero-day vulnerability attacks and the twenty critical controls of cyber defense. The study implies that there is a relationship between cyber defense and a zero-day vulnerability attack. Relationships exist between: (a) attack vector and zero-day vulnerability attacks, (b) attacked platform and zero-day vulnerability attacks, and (c) priority of critical control measures and zero-day vulnerability attacks. Phishing is by far the most prolific attack vector used against the Northcentral University cyber platform. After synthesizing the NCU data, the researchers surmise that ethics training needs to be a deliberate program to recalibrate the collective. Trusting third party software managers, and incentivizing healthy cyber security by end users are two avenues for future exploration.},
