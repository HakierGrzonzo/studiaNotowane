The theory presented in the talk is interesting, as it helps to explain why some design ideas are good and why some are bad. As the concept of including smell or taste in our everyday designs is complicated (personally I think that the ,,sweet” toothbrush would quickly turn into a sticky mess), there always were some efforts to change it. The point that a great design should engage more senses is very easy to see in our modern world, even the best looking keyboard will feel wrong, if there is no feedback, as in Apple’s infamous butterfly design. As technology improves, we may come about some new methods to stimulate our taste and smell senses, until then we will continue to see the ever improving haptic feedback in our everyday designs.
