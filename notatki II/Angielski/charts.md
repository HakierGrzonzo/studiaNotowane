The graph shows number of experts in various technologies and positions in Poland. The figures are given as absolute values. The data for the graph was taken from LinkedIn profiles.

Overall, the graph shows that over 50000 developers claimed that they are familiar with the top 3 technologies, them being JS, Java and Python. The amount of developers for the next two technologies (them being PHP and .NET) is two times lower compered to the top 3, at around 27 thousand. The two professions that are listed in the chart alongside technologies, QA and DevOps, have a much lower number of experts, at 18 thousand for QA and only 10000 for the latter. It is unclear how they were measured compared to technologies, so we are unable to paint a solid trend.

If we will look at the data in the context of industry trends, we will see that the data for poland suggest that most software engineers are using a tech stack composed of javascript for the frontend and either Java or Python for the backend. There is a major lack of other, newer frontend technologies but that may be due to the fact that most TypeScript developers also put JavaScript on their profile, inflating the shown figures. The still significant number of PHP specialists may indicate that many legacy applications are still being maintained in Poland, but without more data it is difficult to make a more concrete conclusion.

Overall the distribution of experts seems to follow various industry trends, but it is also clear, that there is a large number of developers proficient in developing and maintaining solutions based on older tools.
